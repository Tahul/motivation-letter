        <p>To <b>Hytale staff</b>,</p>

        <p>
          I am writing you this cover letter to share my interest about the
          opened <b>Web developer</b> role in your company.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've always been in love with the quality of the content your studio
          produced all along the years working on Hypixel servers.
        </p>

        <p>
          It has always been incredible to see how a passionnate group of people
          can achieve such an incredible result on a game such as Minecraft.
        </p>

        <p>
          When your studio announced Hytale, and all of its content, it was such
          an amazing news for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had to stop my Minecraft servers to pursue my career in web
          development but I have always known I will back at working for that
          kind of community someday.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's great to share that with you, as Minecraft was probably the thing
          that made me start in web development, 8 years ago.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since then, I've used the leverage that Minecraft was to learn a lot
          of things about software and web development, and started a career as
          a web developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've been working in startups and web agencies, to grow my skills on
          libraries such as Vue and React, but also the whole scope of modern
          JavaScript web development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've also been keeping the work on side projects, no longer Minecraft
          servers, but production-ready web apps that are focused on solving my
          daily problems. This has always been a passion for me.
        </p>

        <p>
          All these projects, whether they was made for a company, or for
          myself, has been giving me the confidence to be working for a company
          such as yours.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm sure I could help a lot at building incredible web experiences
          that are linked to the game. Improving the ability of players to share
          their experiences and achievements with the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          It would be a privilege to discuss your <b>Web developer</b> role in
          more detail, I am happy to answer any of your emails
          (<b>yael.guilloux@gmail.com</b>) or phone calls (<b
            >+33 6 64 53 72 18</b
          >).
        </p>

        <p>Thanks for your consideration towards my application,</p>
